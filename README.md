# Multiplatform Mindset

> A complete, practical foundation for Kotlin Multiplatform development - from coroutines to Compose, built for engineers.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive bootstrapper and learning resource for Android developers and software engineers transitioning to **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** and **Compose Multiplatform (CMP)** development.

Built from real-world teaching experience with interns, this open-source knowledge base provides a structured curriculum covering everything from fundamental concepts to advanced patterns in multiplatform development.

## 📚 Learning Path

This curriculum is designed to be followed sequentially, building upon concepts from previous modules:

### Part 1: Foundations
1. **[Understanding KMP and CMP](docs/modules/01-understanding-kmp-cmp/README.md)**  
   What they are, what problems they solve, and why choose KMP/CMP over alternatives like Flutter

2. **[SOLID and CLEAN Principles](docs/modules/02-solid-clean-principles/README.md)**  
   Software design principles, coupling & cohesion, and building maintainable architecture

3. **[MVVM and Unidirectional Data Flow](docs/modules/03-mvvm-architecture/README.md)**  
   Architectural patterns, state management, and unidirectional data flow

### Part 2: Kotlin Essentials
4. **[Kotlin Language Features](docs/modules/04-kotlin-fundamentals/README.md)**  
   Data classes, sealed classes & interfaces, null safety, immutability, when expressions, scope functions, and extensions

5. **[Coroutines Fundamentals](docs/modules/05-coroutines/README.md)**  
   What coroutines are, suspension, cancellation, dispatchers, scopes, jobs, and coroutineContext

6. **[Jobs and Supervisor Patterns](docs/modules/06-jobs-supervisor/README.md)**  
   Job lifecycle, SupervisorJob, supervisorScope, and handling coroutine failures

7. **[Flows and Reactive Programming](docs/modules/07-flows/README.md)**  
   Observer pattern, hot vs cold flows, Flow, SharedFlow, StateFlow, and Channels

### Part 3: Compose and Multiplatform
8. **[Compose Fundamentals](docs/modules/08-compose-fundamentals/README.md)**  
   Declarative vs imperative UI, composition, recomposition, stability, lifecycles, state hoisting, side effects, and best practices

9. **[expect/actual for KMP/CMP](docs/modules/09-expect-actual/README.md)**  
   Platform-specific implementations with common interfaces

10. **[KMP/CMP Internals](docs/modules/10-kmp-internals/README.md)**  
    How Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform work under the hood

### Part 4: Advanced Patterns
11. **[Dependency Injection](docs/modules/11-dependency-injection/README.md)**  
    Inversion of Control, DI frameworks (Dagger, Hilt, Koin), and best practices

12. **[Contributing](docs/modules/12-contributing/README.md)**  
    How to contribute to this knowledge base and help the community

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start with Module 1** and progress sequentially through the curriculum
2. Each module contains:
   - Learning objectives
   - Detailed topic breakdowns
   - Resources and references
   - Links to the next module
3. Take your time with each concept - mastery is more important than speed
4. Practice with code examples (coming soon)
5. Contribute back once you've learned!

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

- **Learning**: Follow the modules in order from 01 to 12
- **Reference**: Jump to specific modules when you need to review a topic
- **Contributing**: See [Module 12: Contributing](docs/modules/12-contributing/README.md) for guidelines

## 🎓 Who This Is For

This resource is designed for:
- **Android Developers** looking to expand to multiplatform development
- **Software Engineers** interested in Kotlin and modern declarative UI
- **Teams** transitioning to KMP/CMP
- **Interns and Junior Developers** learning modern mobile development
- **Anyone** curious about Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose
