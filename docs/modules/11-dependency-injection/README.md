# Module 11: Dependency Injection

## Overview
Dependency Injection is a crucial pattern for building testable, maintainable applications. This module covers IoC (Inversion of Control), various DI frameworks, and best practices for multiplatform projects.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection
- Learn the benefits of using DI in your projects
- Compare different DI solutions (Dagger, Koin, Hilt, etc.)
- Choose the right DI framework for your multiplatform project
- Distinguish between DI containers and Service Locators
