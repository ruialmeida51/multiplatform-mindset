# Module 03: MVVM and Unidirectional Data Flow

## Overview
This module focuses on the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which is the standard approach for this guide. We'll also explore unidirectional data flow and briefly reference other patterns like MVI.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the MVVM architectural pattern
- Learn about unidirectional data flow (UDF)
- Separate concerns between View, ViewModel, and Model layers
- Explore alternatives like MVI (Model-View-Intent)
