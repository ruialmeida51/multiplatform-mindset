# Module 08: Compose Fundamentals

## Overview
Jetpack Compose and Compose Multiplatform represent a paradigm shift in UI development. This comprehensive module covers declarative UI, composition, recomposition, and best practices for building efficient Compose UIs.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand declarative vs imperative UI programming
- Master composition and recomposition
- Learn about stability and skipping mechanics
- Manage state effectively in Compose
- Understand lifecycles and side effects
- Optimize performance and avoid unnecessary recompositions
