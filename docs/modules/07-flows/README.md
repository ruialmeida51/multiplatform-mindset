# Module 07: Flows and Reactive Programming

## Overview
Kotlin Flows provide a reactive programming approach for handling streams of data. This module covers the Observer pattern, different types of flows, and how to work with hot and cold flows.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the Observer pattern and reactive programming
- Learn the difference between hot and cold flows
- Master Flow, SharedFlow, StateFlow, and Channel
- Choose the right flow type for your use case
