# Module 05: Coroutines Fundamentals

## Overview
Kotlin Coroutines provide a powerful way to write asynchronous code that looks sequential. This module covers the fundamentals of coroutines, including suspension, cancellation, and execution contexts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what coroutines are and why they're useful
- Learn how coroutines can be paused (suspended) and cancelled
- Master coroutine scopes and dispatchers
- Work with coroutine contexts and jobs
