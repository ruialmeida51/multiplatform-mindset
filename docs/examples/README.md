# Code Examples

This directory will contain practical code examples demonstrating concepts from each module.

## Structure (Planned)

Examples will be organized by module:

- `01-kmp-cmp-basics/` - Basic KMP/CMP setup examples
- `02-architecture/` - SOLID and CLEAN principle examples
- `03-mvvm/` - MVVM pattern implementations
- `04-kotlin/` - Kotlin language feature demonstrations
- `05-coroutines/` - Coroutine examples
- `06-jobs/` - Job and supervisor pattern examples
- `07-flows/` - Flow examples and patterns
- `08-compose/` - Compose UI examples
- `09-expect-actual/` - Platform-specific implementation examples
- `10-internals/` - Deep dive examples
- `11-di/` - Dependency injection examples

## Coming Soon

Code examples are planned and will be added progressively. Each example will include:
- Complete, runnable code
- Detailed comments explaining key concepts
- README with instructions
- References to relevant module sections
